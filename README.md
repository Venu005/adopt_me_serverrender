# adopt_me
This is a repo containg the project I did,learning from frontend masters.
# To run locally 
    npm i
  This is to download the npm packages needed (node modules)
# What's new
  In this repo,I concentrated on some perfomance based react concepts such as code splitting and server rendering.
# Basic explanation 
  Code splitting is all about suing lazy and Suspense, coming to server side rendering , we use node stream to run Vite app via node,which I felt was cool.
  So many things flowing through my head right now,with overwhelming tech and concepts,let's see what more updates can be made and understood.
